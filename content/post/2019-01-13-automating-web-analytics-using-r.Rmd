### About this note 
1.  Using googleAnalyticR package.
2.  Setting up.
3.  [Data analysis.](#test2)
4.  References.

## Setting up 
 
### 1 Install the following R packages
 
```r
# Install the following R packages for easier data pulling and wrangling.

"googleAnalyticsR"   # to get GA data
"tidyverse"          # must have, includes dplyr, ggplot2, and others
"devtools"           # generally useful
"stringr"            # handy string functions
"lubridate"          # handy date and time functions
"googleVis"          # useful for some visualizations
"ggthemes"           # pretty plot themes
"ggrepel"            # non-obstructive plot labels
"scales"             # custom plot scales
```

### 1.2  Set the view ID and the date range
 
```r
# call and just replace that with a hardcoded value for the view ID. 
# and the start and end date are currently set to choose the last 30 days, but can be hardcoded as well
 
view_id <- Sys.getenv("GA_VIEW_ID")
start_date <- Sys.Date() - 31        # 30 days back from yesterday
end_date <- Sys.Date() - 1           # Yesterday
```
### 2 Authorise GA
 
```r
# will pop over to browser to give authenticate.
ga_auth(token = ".ga-httr-oauth")

# or
ga_auth(new_user = TRUE)  # forces new authorization, even if there is a cached token

```

### 3 Pulling data

```r
# for additional parameters, see ?google_analytics_4() 
# anti_sample = TRUE will ensure we don't get sampled data
 
ga_data <- google_analytics(viewId = view_id,
+                             date_range = c(start_date, end_date),
+                             metrics = "sessions",
+                             dimensions = c("date","deviceCategory"),
+                             anti_sample = TRUE)
```
### 3.1 Quick inspection of returned data

```r
# check returned data, not required but good
head(ga_data)
```
